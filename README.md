# README #

A partial series of solutions for a one-semester course based on Benjamin Pierce's ["Software Foundations"](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/index.html).  Additional chapters will be added as I do the exercises.

I have generally tried to prove every single exercise theorem of 1-, 2-, or 3-star difficulty, and there are a solid number of 4-star and even one or two 5-star exercises done.  Written ("dry") exercises have been very partially done, out of laziness.

### How do I check the proofs? ###

* Install the [Coq proof assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/download).
* Navigate to the folder where you've cloned this repository.
* Either open the relevant chapters in CoqIDE (which comes in the standard Coq distribution) or [Proof General](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/), or execute `make` in a command-line shell to run `coqc` via the included `Makefile`.

### Who can I contact? ###

Either me, via email, or find someone else who might have done the solutions you're looking for.  Or just write to Professor Pierce for help.  Or irc://irc.freenode.net/#coq
